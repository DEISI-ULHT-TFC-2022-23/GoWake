This project aims to introduce a new technological solution that addresses the existing gaps in managing wakeboard sports events and competitions, as requested by the International Waterski and Wakeboard Federation (IWWF). It consists of a back-end system, a mobile application, and a web front-end which is developed by the DEISI297 workgroup, and supported by the REST API. The back-end solution focuses on storing, managing, and facilitating data from the created competitions, as well as implementing algorithms and metrics for athlete heat distribution in accordance with IWWF regulations. Additionally, a mobile application is proposed to interact with the back-end system via the REST API, streamlining and modernizing the entire process of judging athletes' rides. The application includes features that integrate actions from various intervening parties and enables real-time availability of results.
